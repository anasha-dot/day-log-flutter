# day-log-flutter

This repository contains a minimal Flutter application pre-configured with Firebase.

## Getting Started

1. Install Flutter and set up your development environment.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.
3. Configure Firebase for Android, iOS, and Web as described in the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).
4. Run the app with `flutter run`.

The project already includes folders:
- `lib/screens/`
- `lib/widgets/`
- `lib/models/`
- `lib/services/`
- `lib/providers/`

Firebase Auth, Cloud Firestore, and Storage are added as dependencies and initialized in `FirebaseService`.
